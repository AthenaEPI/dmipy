class AnisotropicTissueResponseModel(
        ModelProperties, AnisotropicSignalModelProperties):
    r""" Estimates anistropic TissueResponseModel describing the convolution
    kernel of e.g. anistropic white matter from array of candidate voxels [1]_.

    First, Each candidate voxel is rotated such that the DTI eigenvector with
    the largest eigenvalue is aligned with the z-axis. The rotational harmonic
    (RH) coefficients (corresponding to Y_l0 spherical harmonics) are then
    estimated and saved per acquisition shell. From the estimated
    RH-coefficients the spherical mean per shell is also estimated.

    Once estimated, this class behaves as a CompartmentModel object (so as if
    it were e.g. a cylinder or Gaussian compartment), and only an orientation
    parameter mu and - if the S0 of the input is not normalized to one - also
    its S0-value will not be one.

    A TissueResponseModel has a rotational_harmonics_representation, a
    spherical_mean, and a regular DWI representation. This means a
    TissueResponseModel can be input any MultiCompartment model representation
    in Dmipy, including together with parametric models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    acquisition_scheme : DmipyAcquisitionScheme instance,
        An acquisition scheme that has been instantiated using dMipy.
    data : 2D array of size (N_voxels, N_DWIs),
            Candidate diffusion signal array to generate anisotropic tissue
            response from.
