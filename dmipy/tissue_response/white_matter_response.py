def white_matter_response_tournier07(acquisition_scheme, data, **kwargs):
    """The original white matter response estimation algorithm according to
    [1]_. In essence, it just takes the 300 voxels with the highest FA, aligns
    them with the z-axis, and estimates the averaged white matter response from
    that.

    Parameters
    ----------
    acquisition_scheme : DmipyAcquisitionScheme instance,
        An acquisition scheme that has been instantiated using dMipy.
    data : NDarray,
        Measured diffusion signal array.

    Returns
    -------
    wm_model : Dmipy Anisotropic ModelFree Model
        ModelFree representation of white matter response.
