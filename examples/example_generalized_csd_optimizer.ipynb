    "## Short Summary of CSD:\n",
    "Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) *(Tournier et al. 2007)* is one of the most well-known ways to estimate Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs) that describe the orientation of the white matter tissue. In short, CSD's formulation states that any composition of oriented white matter (dispersion/crossings) can be described as the spherical convolution of a *positive* probability density on the sphere and a convolution kernel $K$ that describes one parallel axon bundle. With some abuse of notation:\n",

    "Here, the FOD is described in terms of a truncated even spherical harmonics series $FOD=\\sum_{l=0}^{lmax}\\sum_{m=-l}^l\\textbf{c}_{lm}Y_{lm}$, with $l$ and $m$ describing the order and moment of the spherical harmonic *(Descoteaux et al. 2006)*. Furthermore, $*_{\\mathbb{S}^2}$ describes a spherical convolution on the $\\mathbb{S}^2$ sphere, and $K$ describes the *rotational* harmonics describing a single axon bundle. The kernel $K$ is typically estimated from the data *(Tournier et al. 2007, Tax et al. 2014)*, and CSD is therefore considered a *model-free* approach."
